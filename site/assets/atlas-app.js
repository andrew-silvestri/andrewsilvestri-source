  /* Four faults lived here, and each was hidden by the one before it.

     ONE. The influence arriving at a node was the SUM of its neighbours, so a
     national grid carrying four thousand plants multiplied any shock by four
     thousand. The spectral radius of the operator was 26 — the iteration could
     not converge, every scenario saturated every reachable node and hit the
     sixty-round ceiling, and the model answered "everything" to every question.

     TWO. Influence used to travel only from an edge's source to its target, so
     a grid outage reached the cities below it and never the plants that feed
     it. Most couplings here run both ways: a grid and its plants, a market and
     its supplies. Two do not. An earthquake acts on a grid and no grid causes
     an earthquake, and the same holds for the climate. So the layers carry a
     rank — climate 0, events 1, everything else 2 — and an edge is two-way
     only between equal ranks. Anything crossing a rank drives and is not
     driven.

     THREE. A node's drivers were not normalised by how many of them there
     were. The write-up said a group of plants feeding one grid shared a fixed
     budget between them; the global rebuild never implemented it. Every one of
     China's 4,235 plants was sending the grid a full 0.246, so the plants
     summed to 1,042 and China's coal supply — 54 per cent of the country's
     power — was three hundredths of one per cent of what the grid was
     listening to. Cutting it did nothing. Each edge is therefore divided by
     the number of edges arriving at the same node from the same layer, so a
     layer speaks once however many members it has, and the members split it.

     FOUR. What remains is divided by the node's total in-weight, which makes
     every node the weighted mean of its drivers and the operator's spectral
     radius exactly 1. With the tanh contraction and the resilience factor the
     iteration is a contraction and settles. */

     had a picture to back them up. propagate() already tracks, per node, the
     hop at which it first moved by 0.02 or more (fh, stored below as hit);
     that is enough to replay the wavefront without keeping a single extra
     copy of the state array. Storing all sixty steps in full would be
     N * 60 * 8 bytes -- about 41MB for this payload -- for a fact this array
     already contains for free.

     replayStep === null means "show the settled state", which is this app's
     entire behaviour before this section existed. Any other value freezes
     the view at that hop: paint() (below) hides every node the wave has not
     reached by then, so scrubbing the slider -- or pressing play -- walks
     the effect outward from the pushed node, one hop at a time. */
