/* The home page's hero: one of three nonlinear systems, integrated live.
 *
 * Double pendulum, Lorenz attractor, or Burrau's three-body problem - one
 * picked at random per load, or forced with ?hero=pendulum|lorenz|threebody.
 * Nothing is a video, nothing is a data file, nothing comes from a CDN: the
 * equations are four to eight lines each and the trajectory is computed as you
 * watch. That is the whole argument for it being here - a figure a reader can
 * see being computed, rather than a picture of one.
 *
 * IT IS NOT THE ENERGY MODEL. The captions said so in as many words until
 * 2026-09-06, when they were cut to about a dozen words each and the clause
 * went with the length. So the argument now lives here and in HANDOFF section
 * 4 rather than on the page: a picture of a nonlinear system on a page about
 * energy modelling is a metaphor, and DESLOP_AUDIT F6 deleted force-bg.js -
 * a real, physically simulated subgraph of the published atlas - for being
 * "decoration that restates the page at illegible size". What still separates
 * this from that is that each caption names a system and its published
 * parameters, and nothing here claims to draw the model. Do not let a later
 * edit quietly make it claim otherwise.
 *
 * ---- the four things that will bite whoever edits this ------------------
 *
 * 1. THE MOTION GATE IS THIS FILE'S JOB, NOT THE STYLESHEET'S. style.css's
 *    [data-motion="off"] block kills animation-duration and transition-
 *    duration. It does nothing whatever to requestAnimationFrame. So this file
 *    reads documentElement.dataset.motion itself, draws one settled frame and
 *    stops if it is not "on", and listens for "motionchange" to tear down.
 *    motion.js's header states that contract; a loop left running behind a page
 *    that says "static" is the failure it exists to prevent.
 *
 * 2. RATE IS DECOUPLED FROM REFRESH RATE, and a constant steps-per-frame does
 *    not do that. It gives the same trajectory SHAPE on every machine but a
 *    rate proportional to the display: on a 120Hz phone everything runs at
 *    double speed, and a 30fps machine looks deliberately slow. So wall time is
 *    accumulated from the rAF timestamp and spent in whole steps, remainder
 *    carried. The `last ? ... : NOMINAL_MS` sentinel is load-bearing: without it
 *    the first frame after every start() sees last === 0, computes a dt of the
 *    page's whole lifetime, and burns the clamp that exists for the cases
 *    visibilitychange cannot see (a GC pause, a closing lid, a breakpoint).
 *
 * 3. THE THREE-BODY NEEDS AN ADAPTIVE STEP AND THIS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. Burrau's
 *    closest approach is ~4e-4, where the dynamical time is ~2.5e-6; a fixed
 *    1e-6 step leaves the encounter unresolved and the run ends with a relative
 *    energy drift of 1.8e+1 - the bodies go wherever truncation error puts
 *    them. Softening it away (eps=1e-3) gives a system that never resolves at
 *    all. Adaptive Cash-Karp is 2,400x CHEAPER as well as correct, because it
 *    takes long steps between encounters: 25,746 of them to t=61.4, against 61
 *    million. tests/verify_hero_systems.js measures all of that and reproduces
 *    Szebehely & Peters 1967; run it before touching EPS2, TOL or escaped().
 *
 * 4. THE TRAIL FADES TOWARD TRANSPARENT, NOT TOWARD PAPER. See fadeBack().
 *
 * Palette is the site's: dark ink on paper. Every reference image of these
 * systems is a glowing line on black and this is the inverse on purpose - it
 * should read as a plotter drawing, like the rest of the site's figures, not as
 * a screensaver. Nothing is ever summed: the one composite operation here is
 * destination-out, an eraser, and trap 10 is about additive blending saturating
 * to white - so trap 10 cannot apply. 2D canvas honours lineWidth, so trap 9
 * does not either. Those are the two traps the constraint list flagged, and
 * choosing a 2D canvas removes both rather than managing them.
 *
 * Design and measurements: 03 RESEARCH/rename-hero/STAGE2_PLAN.md.

  /* ==== the three systems ==============================================
   * Each exposes: reset(), frame(), step(h), trail(alpha), bodies(alpha), and
   * the constants
   *
   * TRAIL AND BODIES ARE SEPARATE BECAUSE THEY RUN AT DIFFERENT RATES. The
   * trail needs one segment per integration step, or it draws a dotted line
   * with gaps where the step was; the rods and discs need drawing once per
   * FRAME, because the front canvas is cleared once per frame and every pass
   * but the last is overwritten. They were one function until 2026-09-06, so
   * seventeen steps a frame meant seventeen redraws of six rods and six discs,
   * sixteen of them invisible. Splitting them was worth ~40% of the frame.
   * H (step), RATE (system time per wall second), CAP (steps a frame may take),
   * FADE (the trail's erosion per frame), settle (units to run undrawn), and a
   * caption.
   *
   * FADE IS PER SYSTEM. The erosion is per frame but the drawing rate is per
   * unit of system time, so one constant gives the fast system a long arc and
   * the slow one a stub that washes out before it grows. A trail survives about
   * 1/FADE frames, so these are roughly 3s, 5s and 20s of memory - chosen so
   * each system shows a comparable LENGTH of trajectory, not a comparable
   * duration. */

     because a low-alpha fill is quantised hard by premultiplication: at alpha
     0.03 the stored alpha is 8/255, and the premultiplied blue of
     rgb(242,240,239) is round(239 * 8/255) = 7, which unpremultiplies to 223.
     Red and green round the other way, to 8. So the colour actually painted is
     not the colour asked for, and the canvas settles wherever that lands:
     measured, an opaque (242,240,224) over the whole viewport - a uniform
     yellow cast on every pixel, including corners no trail can reach, which is
     how it was told apart from trail residue.
     destination-out multiplies the destination's ALPHA by (1 - f) instead.
     Rounding there is strictly downward, so it converges cleanly to fully
     transparent and the page's own --bg shows through exactly. The trail is
