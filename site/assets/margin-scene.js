/* Side-margin generative art: one small canvas per page, drawing a bespoke
 * scene built only from that page's own real, already-published numbers -
 * never invented. Every article page sets a small window.MARGIN_SCENE object
 * before loading this file; this file only knows how to draw a handful of
 * shared primitives ('strata', 'bars', 'flowpulse', 'arcroute', 'cards') - it
 * never picks the numbers, the page does.
 *
 * Geometry comes from the page's own <main> grid, read live via
 * getComputedStyle().gridTemplateColumns, so the art always lines up exactly
 * with the real text column with no guessed pixel widths, and disables
 * itself the instant the grid collapses to one column (mobile) or the margin
 * is too narrow to hold anything legible - the direct answer to "scalable
 * with the resolution, using however much room there is."
 *
 * Layering is the same trick body::before already uses: this canvas paints
 * at z-index 0 (same stacking level, later in the DOM so it paints on top of
 * that static wash), main sits at z-index 1 with no opaque background on its
 * prose, so the scene is fully exposed in the margins beside a paragraph,
 * hidden behind an opaque .fig.wide/video/table, and visible again in the
 * margins flanking one - "dip behind and out the other side" falls out of
 * the stacking order already in style.css, nothing new to add there.
 *
 * Which item is visible, and how strongly, is a function of scroll position
 * and nothing else - the same contract biome-scene.js uses for longevity.html.
 * Every item (a layer, a bar, a flow path, a card, an arc route) is given an
 * `at` (where on the page it lives, 0..1 of the document) and a `span` (how
 * far either side it fades), both derived once from the item's own index and
 * the item count, and a `side` (which margin it prefers) assigned by
 * alternating index so consecutive items land in opposite margins. Opacity
 * is `presence()`, a pure function of `at`/`span` and how far down the
 * document the reader is - no state accumulates frame to frame, so a fast
 * scroll crosses the same fades a slow one does and scrolling back up
 * retraces exactly. Only the small idle motion each kind carries (a dot's
 * shimmer, a bar's breathing, a pulse travelling its path, an arc's wobble,
 * a card's gentle bob) is time-driven, same as biome-scene.js's own
 * distinction between position-driven presence and hand-authored motion.
 *
 * Gated exactly like hero.js: data-motion="off" freezes to one settled
 * frame (never blank) but still repaints on scroll so the reader never sees
 * a frame belonging to a part of the page they have left, motionchange/
 * visibilitychange start and stop the loop, and a missing canvas context
 * degrades to doing nothing.

     side, so it is somewhere on screen for nine spacings in all. That is
     deliberately slow: at `span = 2/n` with no plateau, an item reached full
     opacity at exactly one scroll position and was visibly on its way in or
     out everywhere else, and even a two-spacing fade still read as brisk.
